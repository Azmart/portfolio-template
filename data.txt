Building a Portfolio Website with Streamlit and Hugging Face's Open-Source LLM Model: Combine the power of Streamlit's user-friendly interface with the robust capabilities of Hugging Face's open-source model to create your very own portfolio website. The best part? You don't need to be a tech expert to get started! For the foundation of our portfolio, we utilize the tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct model. This model is both efficient and powerful, requiring only about ~15GB. This makes it feasible even for consumer hardware. When compared to other open-source models such as MPT-7B, StableLM, and RedPajama, it emerges as a standout performer. Its design, having been trained on conversational data, also makes it ideal for crafting chat applications.

Why opt for this tutorial: While there's an abundance of tutorials on crafting Streamlit apps, there's a scarcity of resources dedicated to building a personal portfolio website with it. I've created this step-by-step guide to fill that void. Dive in and discover how to harness the potential of Streamlit for your professional showcase! ðŸ’¼ I hope you find this guide invaluable.
